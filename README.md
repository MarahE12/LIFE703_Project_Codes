# MSc_Project_Codes
These are codes I generated for my project, titled "Evolution of a Genomic Duplicon (Chr31) in Trypanosomatid Parasites"

This repository contains scripts used in my research project, focusing on genomic data analysis and standardisation of gene IDs across different species. The repository includes Python and R scripts for tasks such as translating nucleotide sequences to protein sequences, standardising gene IDs, converting gene IDs to numerical values, and reverse-mapping inferred ancestral gene order.

## Code Descriptions
### Code1_LChr31_Translation.py
This Python script purpose was to translate _Leishmania major_ chromosome 31, to perform tBLASTn to identify homologous chromosomes in other species. The nucleotide FASTA file is required as an input. 

The script performs two main tasks:

1 - Translation of Nucleotide Sequences: Translates nucleotide sequences from a FASTA file into protein sequences for both forward and reverse strands across all three reading frames.

2- Removal of Stop Codons: After translation, stop codons are removed from the protein sequences to ensure continuous protein reading frames and prevent errors in tBLASTn when identifying homologs

Files Produced:
- Translated_Chr31_LmajorFriedlin2021.fasta: Contains translated protein sequences.
- NoStop_Translated_Chr31_LmajorFriedlin2021.fasta: Contains translated protein sequences with stop codons removed.

### Code2_Standardising_GeneIDs.R
This R script standardises  gene IDs by converting species-specific gene IDs into orthogroup IDs as generated by OrthoFinder. It processes GFF files for multiple species to ensure gene IDs are consistent and comparable across all species and for ancestral inference.

Input Files:
- GFF files specific to each species 
- Orthogroup mapping files (*_Orthogroup.tsv) specific to each species.

Steps:

1 - Read GFF files and extract gene names.

2 - Read orthogroup mappings from orthogroup.tsv.

3 - Map gene names to orthogroup IDs and update GFF files.

4 - Save the updated GFF files with standardised gene IDs in an additional column.

### Code3_Convert_Numerical_ID.R
This R script converts the standardised orthogroup IDs using the updated GFF files from Code2 to numerical IDs based on a global mapping. It ensures that the gene order within chromosomes is represented accurately for comparative genomic analyses.

Input Files:
- Standardised GFF files from Code2

Steps:

1 - Create a global mapping from orthogroup IDs to numerical values.

2 - Convert orthogroup IDs to numerical values in GFF files.

3 - Output a .txt file representing the numerical gene order for each species.

### Code4_OG_Reverse-Mapping.R
This R script performs reverse mapping of inferred ancestral gene orders from numerical IDs back to orthogroup IDs. It requires the orthogroup_mapping.csv file created in Code3 for accurate reverse mapping.

Input Files:
- orthogroup_mapping.csv: A CSV file containing the global mapping of orthogroup IDs to numerical IDs, created by Code3.
- geneorder.out: A text file containing the ancestral gene order data inferred by MLGO.

Steps:

1 - Load the orthogroup mapping.

2 - Parse the ancestral gene order file and map numerical IDs to orthogroups.

3 - Output the ancestral gene orders in CSV format.
